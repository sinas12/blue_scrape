<h3> Simple Python Project For Using Selenium to Scrape Data From Webpages </h3><br>
<b> blue_scrape.py </b><br>
basic python program that opens up google in IE and select the search bar in google ( currently google search bar class name is “gLFyf” ) and types “Hi mom” and press ENTER to do the search and writes the source code of the page  in txt called “page_source_of_google_after_typing_hi_mom.txt” file in the same place as the program . 

this program is for demonstration of the way that work is done . after getting the new page source code  you can do anything with it . please be creative there are many projects like this on freelancing sites . you just have to be more creative and play around with code ( some ideas are that you can create a web page and put the scraped information in it so that it becomes user friendly )

## Commands That you need to Run 
```
pip install webdriver-manager
pip install selenium
```
dont forget to be creative and have fun at the same time .

life moves pretty fast If you don't stop and look. around once in a while, you could miss it !
